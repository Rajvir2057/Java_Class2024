do while or while loop?? 
number 1;
While loop checks the condition before executing
the statement(s).
do-while loop executes the statement(s)
at least once before checking the condition.

when to use while loop;
when u only want the condition to repeat in its condition of true.

do_ loop 
to run it many times, but if the condtion is false it printd once,
it can help  in noticing errors.
